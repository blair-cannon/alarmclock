Tech Stack
HTML
CSS
JS

Setup
Create a GitHub repo called "alarm-clock"
Open the GitHub repo in a GitPod by prefixing the GitHub repo URL with this:
Create necessary files for the application using your terminal in your GitPod environment
View and modify the files in your GitPod VSCode IDE
Save all files and create your first commit to main, then create and switch to the 'dev' branch
Application File Structure

repo/
index.html - main page
css/ - folder to contain CSS files
style.css - main stylesheet
img/ - folder to contain any images
js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
main.js - main JavaScript file
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked


Develop
Commit your code to your dev branch
Add content and elements to your website as needed
View changes and test
Debug using console logs and breakpoints
Save often and commit to your dev branch when you have working code


Requirements
Display the current time in a digital clock format
Display in this format: (Hours:Minutes:Seconds) (counting up to something within the same day) and (Day-Month-Year) if applicable (counting up to something on a different day)
Pick a time to make the alarm go off (this can be done as a variable)
Make sure the clock updates every second without refreshing the page
Start the alarm when the difference between the current time and the time the alarm is set for reaches 0 (Tip: use a javascript alert, you do not need it to make noise)


Stretch Goals
Add the date (day, month, and year)
Add a button for toggling between a 12-hour and a 24-hour display
Have a button to snooze the alarm for 5 minutes
Have a toggle to turn on or off the alarm (I only wake up at 6 on the weekdays, but turn off my alarm on the weekend)
Allow the user to pick a time for the alarm to go off using an HTML datetime Input element
Change the font for the display; a mono-spaced font would look more like a digital clock
Play an audible alert when the alarm goes off
Make it look like an analog clock
Share links and resources from this week to the #help slack channel


Deploy
On GitHub, create a Pull Request and merge your code from dev to main
Manually test your code and confirm code is up to date and works correctly
Submit your public URL to complete half of the assignment
Submit your GitHub repo URL to complete the other half of the assignment
